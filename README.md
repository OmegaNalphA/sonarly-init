This is a quick python script to transform heartbeat info into a listenable audio file. It uses `scipy` to translate `numpy` sine waves into music.

Here's how to use it:

1. Install the required packages:

```bash
source ./bin/activate
pip install numpy
pip install scipy
```

2. Run the script:

```bash
python main.py
```

3. Listen to the audio file `heartbeat.wav` in the same directory.
